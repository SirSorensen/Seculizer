Philip notes:
- What are (your) the expectations of us? 

	- How frequent would you like meetings? 
	A weekly/biweekly - Flexsible
	Send a mail the day before of progress
	Prepare questions/subjects for the meeting

	- How would you imagine a plan for the project development period would look? 

- How many standard pages do you expect us to write? 
	Don’t care. 	Put yourself in the mind of the reader. Someone who is seeing it for the first time with the same background while 	understanding everything without getting bored.

- What topics should be covered in depth in the report?

Background
State of the art (related work)

- What do you think about our problem formulation?

We need to define the problem and explain why it is relevant and how we will proceed

“Is it possible to design/prototype a tool that can visualize the protocols”

Other notes:

The report should be “What kind of thinking is there behind this product?”
Write reflections down while implementing the program since it it needed for the above.
